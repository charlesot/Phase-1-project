### Project Overview

This project aims to use data cleaning, imputation, analysis, and visualization of the aviation accident dataset from 1960 to 2023 by the National Transport Safety Board to generate insights for a business stakeholder. The data set includes aviation accidents and incidents in the United States and international waters. The analysis will identify the safest aircraft models, airports, and risk factors associated with aviation accident risks in the United States. The company will use this analysis to determine the aircraft and airports that carry the lowest risks of aviation accidents for investment purposes. 

### Business Problem 

The company is expanding to new industries to diversify its portfolio. Commercial and private enterprises are interested in purchasing and operating airplanes. The company has not conducted any aviation business previously. Accidents have a big reputational and financial risk in the aviation business. The analysis will identify the risks, and evaluate and compare the aircraft accident profiles evaluation to provide data-driven actionable insights. 


### Data 

The data set is publicly available from the National Transportation Safety Board website link: https://www.ntsb.gov/aviationdata/aircraftdata.html. The dataset contains 88,889 rows and 31 columns. It contains event and investigation details, location information, aircraft and flight details, injury and damage information, and report details. The data set selected to draw insights is data from accidents of airplanes and helicopters in the USA.

### Questions to consider :
1. What are the risks related to aviation accidents and incidents in terms of Injury severity, aircraft damage, weather conditions, and flight phases 
2. Frequency of accidents across the different makes and models, focusing on injury severity, aircraft damage, and broad phase of flights 
3. Which aircraft models have the highest and lowest recorded accidents? 
4. What are the common types of damage associated with the aircraft 
5. How does the purpose of flight influence the risk profile of the various aircraft 

### Key Insights 

1. highest risk for airplane and helicopter accidents in the USA
* Most accidents in visual meteorological conditions (VMC) when there is good visibility 
* Most accidents occur during the landing and takeoff broad phases of flights 
* Most accidents result in substantial aircraft damage 
* The highest purpose of flight involved in accidents is personal and instructional Use  
* The highest number of aircraft accidents occur in private airstrips 
* The aviation maker with the highest accident count is Cessna, model 172, and Aviation Engine type of reciprocating 

2. Aeroplane and Helicopter accidents in the USA 
* There was a long period of no accidents from 1983  to 1996, but from 2000 to 2008 there was a progressive increase, after that, there was a minimal reduction in the number of accidents.
* Most of the accidents occur in July  and during the weekend ( Saturday and Sunday)

3. Safest Aeroplane and airport 
* The Safest airport is Pvt Gibson Flying Service 
* The Safest Airplane model is Ru 12
  
### Key recommendations
* Establish  operations from safer commercial airports
* Invest in safer Airplane models
* Develop robust risk mitigation plans on the critical phases of flights prone to accidents (landing and taking off).

### Future improvement 
* Further  workflow data analysis like the number of flights per Aviation model/Make and  flight distances to improve the risk prediction
* Incorporate also data on the number of flights attended per airport or airstrip to  improve the prediction of safety
* Review the cost of purchase and maintenance
* Conduct market analysis taking into consideration the insights
